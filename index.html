           Kettlebell complexes. Keep them simple. Between 3 and 6 exercises. Not a rule. And always keep the transition between exercises in mind if you're creating your own.
	 </p>
	 <p class="text-left">
	   Try to balance upperbody pushing movements with pulling ones. Balance posterior chain with anterior. Always good to have some wee core movement too as a sort of active rest in your complex.

	   Don't be dictated by numbers. The goal is to suffer, but just for a short period time. I'd say 10 - 15 minutes should be about right. But who the fuck knows. It takes me about 8 or 9 minutes to do one full round of option 3.

      4 to 6 rounds of:

	   <li>5 one-armed rows (each arm)</li>

	   <li>5 push presses (each arm)</li>
	   <li>10 step-ups (each leg)</li>

	 1 or 2 rounds of:
	 <ul>
	   <li>Swings</li>
	   <li>Push presses (each arm)</li>
	   <li>Step-ups (each leg)</li>
	   <li>One-armed rows (each arm)</li>
	   <li>Stiff-legged deadlifts</li>
	   <li>Around the worlds (each direction)</li>
	 </ul>
	 <p class="text-left">
	   Initially do 1 rep of each exercise (2 for swings and deadlifts) and once you complete a full cycle, increase to 2 reps (4 for swings and deadlifts). Continue doing this until you reach 5 reps (10 for swings and deadlifts). Then decrease to 4 reps (8 for swings and deadlifts) and continue doing this until you reach 1 rep. The 1 rep cycle is the end.
	 </p>
	 <p class="text-left">
	   If you do two rounds, take about 60s rest between each. Try to not take more than 120s. But in reality just take as long as you feel you need to mentally start the second one. Be as weak as you want.

	   As way of progressions, maybe start with 4 sets of option 1. Try and finish it quicker and quicker. When you start seeing no progression with respect to time, go up to 5 and do the same. And then again with 6 sets. When you stop seeing any progress with 6, advance to option 2. Continue the process with option 2, starting with 4 sets and finishing with 6. Then move on to one set of option 3. Faster, faster, then two rounds of option 3. Basically trying to cram in as much in as little amount of time as possible.
